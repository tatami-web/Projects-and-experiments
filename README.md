# Project Repository: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Welcome to this repository! Here, you will find multiple projects built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project is organized in its respective folder for better navigation and management.

## About This Repository

- **Learning in Progress:** The projects here are part of my learning journey. Most of them might not work correctly, as they are created to help me acquire knowledge and grow as a developer.
  
- **Expectations:** You won’t find high-level projects here yet—this is a space to experiment, make mistakes, and improve over time.  

- **Organization:** Each folder in this repository contains an individual project or experiment, consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  

## Repository Structure

- Each project is stored in a separate folder.

- Inside each folder, you'll find the source code and a detailed explanation of:

  - How the project was created.
